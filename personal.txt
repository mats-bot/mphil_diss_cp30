FOR PERSONAL USE WHILE DEVELOPING

each time i run activate env like this:
    conda activate calliope-CP30-rep

    shouldn't need: mamba env create -f environment.yml

to test certain parts (check file name)
    snakemake --use-conda data/intermediates/GSP_timeseries.csv

if permission issue with files, run from command prompt:
    attrib -r +s "path of the folder"


# Writing transmission links file
# Wrinting onshore links file
with open("config/default.yaml") as f:
    config = yaml.safe_load(f)
target_year = str(config["default_year"])

links = {}
for _, row in links_df.iterrows():
    zone_pair = "-".join(sorted([row["Zone 1"], row["Zone 2"]]))
    capacity = row[target_year]

    constraints = {
        "techs": ["ac_transmission"],
        "constraints": {}
    }
