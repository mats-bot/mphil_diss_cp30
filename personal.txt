FOR PERSONAL USE WHILE DEVELOPING

each time i run activate env like this:
    conda activate calliope-CP30-rep

    shouldn't need: mamba env create -f environment.yml

to test certain parts (check file name)
    snakemake --cores all --use-conda data/intermediates/GSP_demand_coords.csv

if permission issue with files, run from command prompt:
    attrib -r +s "path of the folder"
